    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where editor text markers (such as color pickers) stuck
        around after the line it's on has been folded out of sight.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where these text markers would not appear when lines above
        them are folded.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where you wouldn’t be shown as signed in if you sign out
        and then sign back in again in the same session.</li>
      <li>(Mapzen platform improvement!) Sign-in window now closes automatically
        after you've signed in. If it doesn't, you should be seeing a button
        that manually closes the popup window.</li>

    <h3>Tangram Play is now in public beta!</h3>

    <p>
      We’re excited to release the public beta of Tangram Play, a text
      editor for working with Tangram, our web map rendering library.
      Your use of Play during this phase will help us improve our tools
      for web map design.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're new here, find out more about Tangram Play on the
      <a href="https://mapzen.com/blog/tangram-play-public-beta-launch">Mapzen</a> blog.
      The <a href="./docs/">walkthrough</a> gives a brief explanation of the
      interface, whether you’re creating from a blank slate or using one of our
      Mapzen <a href="https://mapzen.com/products/maps/">basemaps</a>.

    <p>
      If you’ve been here before, welcome back! There's been a few changes to
      the interface that we’ll describe below.
    </p>

    <h3>New features</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Save a scene to your Mapzen account!</strong> Now you can access
        your scenes from anywhere. With this improvement, we’ve replaced the
        ability to save to an anonymous GitHub Gist, but if you've saved an
        anonymous Gist in the past, you can still load those, and save them
        again to get it into your Mapzen account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Share your scenes.</strong> Once you've saved your scene, we also
        host it for you. Now there’s an easy way to share it with friends or
        link it from your website or social media!
      </li>
    </ul>
