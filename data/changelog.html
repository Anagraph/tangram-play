    <h3>Tangram Play is now in public beta!</h3>

    <p>
      We’re excited to release the public beta of Tangram Play, a text
      editor for working with Tangram, our web map rendering library.
      Your use of Play during this phase will help us improve our tools
      for web map design.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’ve been here before, welcome back! There's just a few new things.
      For more information about this release, check out

    </p>

    <h3>New features</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>New scene saving!</strong> Saving scenes will now save to your Mapzen account! Now you can access your scenes from anywhere when you log in. This also means we've removed the ability to save to an anonymous Gist, but if you've saved scenes to an anonymous Gist in the past, you can still load those and save them again to get it into your Mapzen account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Share your scenes.</strong> Once you've saved your scene, you want a really easy way to share it with friends or link it from your blog / social media account, right? Now you can!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Let us know what you think</h3>

    <p>We have GitHub issues, Gitter, and an e-mail address.</p>
