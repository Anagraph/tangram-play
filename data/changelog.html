    <h2>Welcome to the Tangram Play public beta test!</h2>

    <p>
      You are one of the brave souls who will help us test Tangram Play and shape it to be a wonderful and useful tool for all Tangram users. If you've been here before, welcome back! There's just a few new things. If you're new here, find out more about Tangram Play <a href="https://mapzen.com/blog/">on the Mapzen blog</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>New scene saving!</strong> Saving scenes will now save to your Mapzen account! Now you can access your scenes from anywhere when you log in. This also means we've removed the ability to save to an anonymous Gist, but if you've saved scenes to an anonymous Gist in the past, you can still load those and save them again to get it into your Mapzen account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Publish your scenes.</strong> Once you've saved your scene, you want a really easy way to share it with friends or link it from your blog / social media account, right? Now you can!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let us know what you think</h2>

    <p>We have GitHub issues, Gitter, and an e-mail address.</p>
