    <h3>Mapzen platform update</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Heads up! Mapzen is updating its vector tile service on March 1, 2017
      to require an API key for access.</strong>
      (See <a href="https://mapzen.com/blog/api-keys-required/" target="_blank">the blog</a>
      for more information.)
    </p>

    <p>
      If you save or open an existing scene file and we
      see that you’re using a Mapzen tile service without an API key, we’ll
      now provide a warning. Your scene files will continue to work in Tangram
      Play, but if you plan to use the scene elsewhere, you’ll want
      to add your own API key as soon as possible. (If you’re not using a
      Mapzen vector tile service, you won’t be affected by this.)
    </p>

    <h3>Improvements</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We’ve overhauled the <strong>Get code snippet</strong> dialog box. Before,
        it displayed a small snippet of JavaScript, but it wasn’t obvious that you
        still needed Leaflet and Tangram to run it. Now, we also show the entire
        HTML context for both Mapzen.js or Leaflet/Tangram so you can just copy
        and paste the whole thing into an HTML file. However, if JavaScript-only
        code is still your preference, you can toggle the HTML off too.

    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The editor would still say “You have unsaved changes” after saving a
        scene to your Mapzen account. Whoops. We fixed it!</li>
      <li>Thumbnails for example scene files are now displaying properly on Firefox.</li>

    <h3>Improvements!</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mapzen platform improvement!</strong> Sign-in window now closes automatically
        after you've signed in. If it doesn't, you should be seeing a button
        that manually closes the popup window.</li>
      <li>Added the “Get started” documentation as an option in the Help menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where editor text markers (such as color pickers) stuck
        around after the line it's on has been folded out of sight.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where these text markers would not appear when lines above
        them are folded.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where you wouldn’t be shown as signed in if you sign out
        and then sign back in again in the same session.</li>

    <h3>Tangram Play is now in public beta!</h3>

    <p>
      We’re excited to release the public beta of Tangram Play, a text
      editor for working with Tangram, our web map rendering library.
      Your use of Play during this phase will help us improve our tools
      for web map design.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're new here, find out more about Tangram Play on the
      <a href="https://mapzen.com/blog/tangram-play-public-beta-launch">Mapzen</a> blog.
      The <a href="./docs/">walkthrough</a> gives a brief explanation of the
      interface, whether you’re creating from a blank slate or using one of our
      Mapzen <a href="https://mapzen.com/products/maps/">basemaps</a>.

    <p>
      If you’ve been here before, welcome back! There's been a few changes to
      the interface that we’ll describe below.
    </p>

    <h3>New features</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Save a scene to your Mapzen account!</strong> Now you can access
        your scenes from anywhere. With this improvement, we’ve replaced the
        ability to save to an anonymous GitHub Gist, but if you've saved an
        anonymous Gist in the past, you can still load those, and save them
        again to get it into your Mapzen account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Share your scenes.</strong> Once you've saved your scene, we also
        host it for you. Now there’s an easy way to share it with friends or
        link it from your website or social media!
      </li>
    </ul>
